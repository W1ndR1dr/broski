# Ideas Backlog

Dump ideas here. No idea too rough. We'll refine the good ones.

## Core Features (v1 vision)

- [ ] "Local guide" persona that dynamically learns ANY mountain (no hard-coded resort info)
- [ ] Current conditions awareness (weather, snow, wind)—discovered at runtime
- [ ] Time-of-day advice ("hit X before it tracks out")
- [ ] Photo analysis from chairlift ("what am I looking at?")
- [ ] Dynamic local knowledge synthesis (searches forums, Reddit, blogs live—not a stored database)

## Open Questions

- How does the system dynamically discover local knowledge for any mountain? (Web search, forums, Reddit, blogs—at runtime, not stored)
- Mobile app? Web app? Just a chat interface to start?
- How do we handle real-time conditions? APIs? Scraping?
- What's the minimum context the user provides? (Just "I'm at Alta" and it figures out the rest?)

## Wild Ideas (Maybe Someday)

- AR overlay showing lines on the mountain
- Voice interface for hands-free on the lift
- Social layer—share beta with friends
- Multi-mountain support with personality per resort
- Integration with ski tracking apps (Slopes, etc.)

## Technical Rabbit Holes to Explore

- Vision models for terrain analysis
- How to build persistent "knowledge" about a mountain
- Real-time data ingestion patterns
- Prompt engineering for consistent persona
