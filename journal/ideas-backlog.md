# Ideas Backlog

Dump ideas here. No idea too rough. We'll refine the good ones.

## Core Features (v1 vision)

- [ ] "Local guide" persona that knows a specific mountain
- [ ] Current conditions awareness (weather, snow, wind)
- [ ] Time-of-day advice ("hit X before it tracks out")
- [ ] Photo analysis from chairlift ("what am I looking at?")
- [ ] Local knowledge ingestion (forums, Reddit, blogs)

## Open Questions

- What mountain do we start with? Alta (the obvious choice)? Somewhere else?
- How do we get "local knowledge" into the system? Web scraping? Manual curation?
- Mobile app? Web app? Just a chat interface to start?
- How do we handle real-time conditions? APIs? Scraping?

## Wild Ideas (Maybe Someday)

- AR overlay showing lines on the mountain
- Voice interface for hands-free on the lift
- Social layer—share beta with friends
- Multi-mountain support with personality per resort
- Integration with ski tracking apps (Slopes, etc.)

## Technical Rabbit Holes to Explore

- Vision models for terrain analysis
- How to build persistent "knowledge" about a mountain
- Real-time data ingestion patterns
- Prompt engineering for consistent persona
