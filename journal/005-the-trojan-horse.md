# The Trojan Horse: Learning Transfer as the Actual Goal

**Date:** January 2025
**Author:** Brian

## The Setup

I've been AGI-pilled for years. GPT-3 API playground before ChatGPT existed. Reading Yudkowsky in 2021 and realizing something big was coming. Watching the curve bend.

My brothers haven't been on this journey. They're smart, capable, but haven't lived in this world the way I have. I want to transfer what I've learned—not by lecturing, but by *building together*.

## Why a Project, Not a Lecture

You can't transfer intuition through explanation. "AI is going to change everything" lands differently when you've *felt* what it can do. When you've:

- Had the AI solve something you thought would take hours
- Pushed back on bad output and watched it get better
- Felt the difference between shitty vibe coding and building with care
- Seen an idea crystallize through iteration

The project is the vehicle. The ski app is something we'd actually use, so we'll stay engaged. But the point isn't the app—it's developing the intuition together.

## What I Want to Transfer

1. **The capability intuition**: What AI can and can't do *right now*. Where to trust it, where to push back, where it hallucinates.

2. **The craft stance**: Output with care >>> yolo. First drafts are drafts. Iterate until it's actually good.

3. **The ideation inversion**: Ideas are now the bottleneck, not execution. Spend your time thinking, not just prompting.

4. **The bitter lesson applied**: Build general systems. Don't hard-code. Trust compute.

5. **The AI-native mindset**: Build things that couldn't exist before, not faster versions of old things.

6. **The collaboration multiplier**: Human ↔ AI ↔ Human produces better than any alone.

## Why This Repo Structure

The journal isn't just documentation—it's the learning made visible.

When my brothers read these entries, they see:
- The principles we're operating on
- How we arrived at them (through collaboration, not decree)
- That this is an ongoing conversation, not a finished answer

When they add their own entries, they become co-authors of the philosophy, not just recipients.

## The Bet

In 6 months, I want my brothers to:
- Have intuition for AI capabilities they didn't have before
- Be able to build ambitious things with care
- Understand *why* certain approaches work and others don't
- Feel like they discovered this themselves, not like I taught them

The ski app is gravy. The transformation is the point.

## The Vibe

This isn't me being the expert and them being students. I'm learning too—every project teaches something new. We're exploring together.

The best outcome: they teach me something I didn't know.
