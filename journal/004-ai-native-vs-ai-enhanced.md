# AI-Native vs. AI-Enhanced

**Date:** January 2025
**Author:** Brian + Claude

## The Moment This Clicked

Early in brainstorming BroSki, Claude suggested ideas like:
- Pow day alert system
- Trip planner / resort recommender
- Conditions aggregator

Brian pushed back: *"I want something more AI native, something nascent that doesn't or couldn't exist pre-AI... that's the sort of ambition I find captivating right now."*

That's the distinction worth naming.

## AI-Enhanced

Things that existed before, made better/faster/cheaper by AI:

- **Trip planner**: Travel agents existed. AI makes it faster.
- **Conditions aggregator**: Weather apps existed. AI adds synthesis.
- **Pow day alerts**: Email alerts existed. AI adds smarts.

These are valuable. They're not *new*.

The pattern: Take existing workflow → add AI → workflow is better.

## AI-Native

Things that couldn't meaningfully exist before the AI capabilities of ~2024:

- **Point at terrain, have a conversation about it**: Requires vision + reasoning + domain knowledge synthesis
- **Coaching dialogue about your ski form**: Requires video understanding + natural language + personalized feedback
- **Dynamic "local guide" that knows any mountain**: Requires real-time knowledge synthesis, not a database

The pattern: AI capability enables *fundamentally new* interaction or experience.

## Why This Matters

AI-enhanced is a fine business. Lots of value to capture.

But AI-native is where the *interesting* problems are. Where you're exploring what's newly possible. Where the thing you're building teaches you about the frontier.

For learning purposes—which is our actual goal—AI-native is more valuable. You're forced to understand the capabilities and limits of current AI. You can't just bolt AI onto an existing pattern.

## How to Tell the Difference

Ask: **"Could this have been built in 2020 with enough engineering effort?"**

- Yes → AI-enhanced (AI makes it easier, not possible)
- No → AI-native (AI makes it *possible*)

BroSki's "point your phone at a run and have a conversation" couldn't exist in 2020. Vision models weren't good enough. Reasoning wasn't coherent enough. The experience would have been a gimmick, not useful.

Now it can be real. That's the space we want to play in.

## The Risk of AI-Native

It's harder. You're building on capabilities that are:
- Rapidly evolving (what's impossible today may be easy in 6 months)
- Sometimes unreliable (hallucinations, inconsistency)
- Not fully understood (even by the people who made them)

You're building on a moving foundation. That's uncomfortable.

But it's also where the learning is deepest. You develop intuition for what AI can and can't do *right now*, and how to work around limits.

## Our Bet

BroSki is deliberately AI-native:
- Vision understanding of terrain
- Real-time knowledge synthesis (not a database)
- Natural conversation with persistent context
- Reasoning about conditions, timing, and tradeoffs

If these capabilities didn't exist, this project wouldn't be possible. That's the point.

## Discussion

**Brian:**
The ambition to build something that *couldn't exist before* is part of what makes this exciting. We're not optimizing an old workflow—we're exploring new territory.

**Claude:**
There's also something to be said for AI-enhanced as a learning path—simpler, more predictable, lower risk of hitting capability walls. But for developing intuition about the frontier, AI-native forces deeper engagement.

**Together:**
For BroSki, AI-native is the right choice. We're here to learn the frontier, not to ship the safest product. The goal is developing taste and intuition for what's newly possible.
