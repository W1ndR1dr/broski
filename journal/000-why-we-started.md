# Why We Started This

## The Idea

We love skiing. We've all got that one Alta trip living rent-free in our heads—the storm, the powder, the whole experience. That's the bar.

The idea: an AI that acts like a local guide who's skied your mountain for 20 years. Not just conditions and stats—actual *advice*. "Hit the north face now before it gets tracked." "That chute looks sketchy but skier's left has a better line." "The groomers will soften up around 11, go hit the steeps first."

Point your phone at a run from the chairlift. Ask what you're looking at. Get real answers.

## The Meta-Objective

But the ski app is really just a vehicle.

The actual goal: learn how to build with AI the *right* way. There's a spectrum from "shitty vibe coding" (accept first output, no iteration, no standards) to "extraordinary AI-native building" (taste, craft, intention, knowing when to push back).

We're learning the good kind. Together. As brothers who happen to be 2,000 miles apart.

## What "Good" Means to Us

- Output with care and effort >>> yolo first-draft acceptance
- Understanding *why* something works, not just that it works
- Iteration until it's actually good, not just functional
- Documenting what we learn so we can look back and see growth
- Building something we'd actually use

## Let's Go

First task: flesh out what this thing actually looks like. What's v0.1? What mountain do we start with? What does "local knowledge" even mean in practice?

Let's figure it out.
