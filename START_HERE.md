## 1. Install Claude Code

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

(Need Node.js? Get it at nodejs.org)

## 2. Clone and Enter

```bash
git clone https://github.com/W1ndR1dr/broski.git
cd broski
```

## 3. Run Claude

```bash
claude
```

It'll ask you to log in the first time. Do that.

## 4. Start Talking

Once you're in, try:

> "Read the journal entries and summarize the key principles for me"

or

> "What's BroSki and what are we building?"

or just

> "What should I do first?"

Claude's read the repo. It knows the vibe. Ask it anything.

That's it. You're in.
