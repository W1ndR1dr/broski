# How We Collab

Keep it simple. This isn't a company—it's brothers building together.

## The Basics

- **Git shows who did what**: Commits are signed, history is visible
- **Journal entries are signed**: Put your name in the Author field
- **No permission needed**: See something to improve? Do it. Add an idea? Do it.

## Async Rhythms

We're spread across time zones (CA ↔ MI). Async is the default.

**For quick ideas/reactions:**
- Drop a note in `/journal/ideas-backlog.md`
- Sign it with your name so we know who's thinking what

**For bigger thoughts:**
- Create a new journal entry (`0XX-your-title.md`)
- Doesn't have to be polished—rough thinking is fine
- Show your work: what you tried, what you learned, what you're stuck on

**For actual code:**
- Just commit to main for now (we're small, branches are overkill)
- Write a commit message that explains the *why*, not just the what

## Working with Claude Code

Each of us runs Claude Code locally against this repo. Some tips:

- **Tell Claude about the journal**: "Read the journal entries to understand our principles"
- **Ask Claude to document learnings**: "Add what we just figured out to the journal"
- **Use Claude as a thinking partner**: Not just code generation—ideation, pushback, refinement
- **Share interesting convos**: If Claude says something insightful, capture it

## The Vibe We Want

- **Low friction**: If process slows you down, skip it
- **Show your work**: Half-formed thoughts are welcome
- **Riff on each other**: See someone's idea? Build on it, push back, extend it
- **Celebrate learning**: "I was wrong about X" is a win, not a failure

## When to Sync

Sometimes async isn't enough. For big decisions or when you're stuck:
- Phone call > endless text threads
- Screen share if you need to show something
- But default to async—let ideas marinate

*The goal is to feel like we're building together even when we're alone.*
